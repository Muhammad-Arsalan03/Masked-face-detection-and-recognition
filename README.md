# Masked-face-detection-and-recognition
This is the final year project of Electrical engineering department during the pandemic. Thus, it became the need to detect and recognize the person while wearing the mask.

Dataset3.ipynb is the main file for training, testing, validation of face mask detection and recognition
and also in the last part of this file include the code for real time face mask detection and recognition 
through webcam video.

Final_masked_face.h5 is the trained model of face mask detection and recognition.
final_V2.mp4 is the output of our algorithm on a video in which different persons face are accurately recognised.
